## Understanding this Repository

This repository contains two game folders. Both of their main.py files can be run on their own without relying on
other files within the directory.


## About Each Project

### Tic Tac Toe
This game takes inputs as mouse clicks. It is designed as a two player game and takes the user input of two people.
To play a move, simply click on the desired box on the respective player's turn. The first player should click first.

### Hangman
This game takes user inputs from the terminal. Simply type in the terminal as instructed. Instructions will be printed
to it. For each incorrect guess, a part of the man will be erased.
